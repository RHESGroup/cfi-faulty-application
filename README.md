# Faulty Application
This repository contains a faulty application for the SEcube, SEUAM, device.
The application communicate over bluethoot; 
a vulnerability has been arbitrarily inserted within the data exchange protocol (not in the bluethoot itself) that allows the exploitation of buffer overflows to launch a return oriented programming attack.

The firmware still requires some tweaking and adjustment.
